Piemenu YUI3 Widget by Mikhail Panchenko <m@mihasya.com>

This is a simple YUI3 widget for creating a Pie menu. By default, it expects 
that the items intended as menu items will be within the container div. Methods
to add items to it from within javascript will be added shortly.

P1:
@todo cutomizable animation speeds
@todo extensive demos/docs
@todo add events to communicate state
@todo make all animations optional; only load anim module when needed
@todo add validation to ATTR, as well as "writeOnce" where appropriate

P2:
@todo add "move" method for adjusting x and y (conscious of anchor)
@todo add "desired position" to pieItem so as to avoid having a separate 
        _scheduleClose method (reuse _scheduleAnimation)
@todo make _scheduleAnimation smarter (take advantage of desired position)
@todo two _anim objects for items, conscious of each other (buffering)
        i.e. if one is actively running, assign next animation to the 
        other one and only stop the first one when the second one is ready to go
@todo figure out if it's possible to animate along a curve so rotate animations
        can be single animation objects, instead of the new position having to
        be recalculated all the damn time.
@todo "swaying" idle animation (customizable)

DONE:
@todo move item positioning into main class as a method for easy customization
@todo shrink and expand items when closing and opening
@todo add "close" method that animates the items to the middle, then hides
