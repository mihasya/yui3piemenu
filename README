Piemenu YUI3 Widget by Mikhail Panchenko <m@mihasya.com>

This is a simple YUI3 widget for creating a Pie menu. By default, it expects 
that the items intended as menu items will be within the container div. Methods
to add items to it from within javascript will be added shortly.

Planned features:
 - Custom open/close animations
 - "Idle" animations, such as the menu swaying back and forth (custimizable)
