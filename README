Piemenu YUI3 Widget by Mikhail Panchenko <m@mihasya.com>

This is a simple YUI3 widget for creating a Pie menu. By default, it expects 
that the items intended as menu items will be within the container div. Methods
to add items to it from within javascript will be added shortly.

@todo add "close" method that animates the items to the middle, then hides
@todo add "move" method for adjusting x and y (conscious of anchor)
@todo add validation to ATTR, as well as "writeOnce" where appropriate
@todo shrink and expand items when closing and opening
@todo two _anim objects for items, conscious of each other (buffering)
        i.e. if one is actively running, assign next animation to the 
        other one and only stop the first one when the second one is ready to go
@todo figure out if it's possible to animate along a curve so rotate animations
        can be single animation objects, instead of the new position having to
        be recalculated all the damn time.
@todo add an event for "open complete" so that other animations know to wait
@todo "swaying" idle animation (customizable)
@todo extensive demos/docs

DONE:
@todo move item positioning into main class as a method for easy customization
